## 📘 Overview

**EduSphere** is a centralized web-based platform designed to simplify and digitize university academic management and student support services. It integrates academic records, administrative workflows, communication channels, and student services into a single, secure, and role-based system.

The platform improves transparency, reduces manual workload, and enhances the overall experience for students, faculty, and administrators.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Most universities rely on multiple disconnected systems and informal communication methods for managing:

- Attendance  
- Examinations and results  
- Scholarships and internships  
- Mentoring and grievance handling  

This fragmented approach results in delayed responses, lack of transparency, repeated queries, and inefficient administrative operations.
